# **Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning**  

## **📌 Overview**  
Loan approval is a critical process for financial institutions, determining whether an applicant qualifies for a loan based on various factors. This project leverages **machine learning (ML) algorithms** to predict loan approval decisions based on applicant details such as income, credit history, and employment status.  

## **🛠️ Technologies Used**  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries & Frameworks:**  
  - `Pandas`, `NumPy` – Data preprocessing  
  - `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` – Data visualization  
  - `Scikit-learn` – Machine learning models  
  - `Flask / Streamlit` – Web app for predictions  
- **Algorithms Used:**  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Random Forest  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
  - XGBoost  

## **📂 Dataset**  
The dataset consists of multiple applicant features such as:  
✅ Applicant & Co-applicant Income  
✅ Loan Amount & Loan Term  
✅ Credit History  
✅ Employment & Property Details  

We picked our dataset from kaggle.com
